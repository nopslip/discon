        <b>Talk Abstract: </b>Though super computers have been built for over 50 years, it took the coordinated processing and socioeconomic phenomenon of bitcoin and the blockchain PoW algorithm to truly give us this next generation of commoditized data processing.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Bio: </b> Jason has some early stories about performance computing builds. A favorite is about his first notable GPU build in ~1997 for a University professor that was running NASTRAN, a finite element analysis program developed by NASA. In Jason's words "We built an Intel Pentium II MMX ( with L1 cache of 16kb), megabytes of ram and hard disk space, and suspiciously a Matrox Millenium video card. My coworkers were thrilled, the sales guy made a fortune(I am sure) but we burned it in playing Doom. So, I get the job of delivering the machine. It was great and not really what I expected. He's there eagerly awaiting the delivery of his new computer. I set it up get him logged in. He then opens a cmd prompt, inserts a floppy disk and runs a simple CAD simulation command. We sit there and literally in the command window is line data, 1 Mississippi.. line data 1 Mississippi, ..line data 1 Mississippi, the professor looks back at me, smiles, and says "man that's fast". I just gave him the nod said I am headed out, and left while he continued to watch line data, 1 Mississippi.. line data 1 Mississippi, ..line data 1 Mississippi... sweet"
        </p>
        <p>
        Many years and projects later, Jason remembers the conversation when he first heard of "bitcoin mining" with a colleague of his. Colleague said "I have been mining bitcoin with video hardware kinda like playing a game". Jason thought hmm, really?, and then immediately rolled up his sleeves to provide his friend with a GPU accelerated Windows Hyper-V Workstation. Friend was impressed, and Jason's appetite for bitcoin mining began.
        </p>
        <p>
        By this point in time Jason had already been heating his house by running FEM simulation hardware and encryption services and regularly had a utility bill of >2.5X his neighborhood average. Jason then started mixing in bitcoin mining.
        </p>
        <p>
        Blockchain and the emergence of cryptocurrencies has helped coordinated performance computing in so many ways. OpenCL and NVidia grid computing's successes can directly correlate to the emergence of crypto-mining. Now an ASIC the size of a thumb drive can SHA256 work at gigahash rates!

      </p> 
      <p>
      Polis believes that education is the single most meaningful investment America can make in its economic future and in its people. His efforts in this area focus on making accountability work at all levels, expanding educational models, and improving persistently failing schools with data-driven changes to successful achievement gaps.
       <p>
      Polis also works with Democrats and Republicans to reform our nation’s broken immigration policies, to advance the cause of civil rights and equality for all, and to protect Colorado and the world’s natural beauty and environment.

      <p><b>Talk Abstract: </b> Blockchains coordinate human behavior at unprecedented scales; commensurately, we now face a governance challenge unlike any other. This talk presents a solution to the decentralized governance of blockchain protocols inspired by futarchy. Under this paradigm, a system-wide metric is used to determine the efficacy of proposals predicted to improve the system's utility via the action of prediction markets. By choosing a metric tied to the behavior of the blockchain's validators, we find an incentive-compatible governance mechanism that avoids the failings of a variety of other solutions in the ecosystem. We conclude by surveying these alternatives and show how this system improves upon their shortcomings through the lens of cryptoeconomics.
      </p>
      <p><b>Bio: </b>Alex Stokes (@ralexstokes) is a cryptoeconomist who has been studying blockchains since 2011 while at Princeton University. He thinks that governance is the biggest challenge blocking the widespread adoption of these systems and spends his time leading the discourse on how we can best collectively use the "decentralized commons". Outside of his work on governance, Alex is an active open source contributor to cryptocurrency projects like Ethereum's Casper proof-of-stake protocol.

       <b>Talk Abstract: </b>Beginning in March of 2017, we've seen Bitcoin dominance drop from above 80% down to as low as the mid 30s. The reasons for this are hotly debated, but it's undeniable space has been made for new approaches including DPOS, Delegated Proof of Stake, which powers the most active blockchains on the planet including BitShares, STEEM, and more recently, EOS. This cooperation over competition model for securing blockchains goes beyond protocol consensus to include on-chain governance. This new environment allows not only for DACs, Distributed Autonomous Communities, but for a new token-driven economy where incentives between token holders, block producers, users, and workers are in full alignment
       </p>
       <p>
        In this talk, we'll explore DPOS, DACs, and on-chain governance. We'll see how the promise of blockchain disruption is being realized through enterprise-ready solutions for real-world applications. Examples will include the BitShares DEX, Steemit, DTube, DLive, Utopian.io, and more.

        Kent fell headlong down the blockchain rabbit hole in 2012 after learning about Bitcoin. In 2014 he founded Ethereum Denver, aiming to position the Denver/Boulder region as a vibrant hub of innovation in the realm of distributed computing and decentralized smart contracts. Earlier this year he served as a co-organizer for the ETHDENVER hackathon – an event that attracted over 1000 developers, entrepreneurs, investors, and other tech enthusiasts from dozens of countries. 
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	His primary concerns at the moment are a.) how to successfully scale the local and global Ethereum community, and b.) how to preserve the foundation of respectful, academic discourse that makes Ethereum such a cool place to be. Kent works in the blockchain industry full-time, and has a Master's Degree in Political Science from C.U. Denver.

	<b>Talk Abstract: </b>
        We examine scaling blockchain through the lens of the popular "scalability trilemma." We explore various scaling optimizations and their costs. We find the trilemma to be imprecise and that a variety of scalability solutions commonplace outside blockchain satisfy all three properties of the trilemma. We also find appealing optimizations at the edges of the trilemma and propose a modernized definition of decentralization that can reasonably accommodate a scaling blockchain.

         <b>Talk Abstract: </b> Software has a very diverse set of purposes and problem constraints. It is not uncommon to hear "we need to use the right tool for the right job". But how do we decide what the right tool is? What makes something better or worse suited for a problem domain. This question has been debated from time to time, but has largely fell quiet as the world has been dominated by web application software development. Trustware (commonly described as "blockchain technology") is qualitatively different than any other software that has ever been written in some key ways. Due to the high stakes nature of the difficulty in upgrading it, in conjunction with the vast value that we have chosen to endow these systems with, nonchalant attitudes of "F*** it ship it" are not tenable in this space. We need to start treating our industry with more humility and respect, and adopt tools, techniques and practices that are aligned with the seriousness of what we are building. This talk will talk about the benefits of things such as Haskell, Rust, and other such languages that brutally require thoroughly thinking about details, in stark contrast to things such as javascript. This talk will not leave people with the knowledge of being able to use any of these tools, but rather with a motivation for exploring them as the constraints of our industry evolve.

         Of all the people in the world who have a bank account, only one in a thousand are involved in Cryptocurrency. This is a gigantic opportunity for a single company, or group of companies, to break out of the early-adopter market and bring crypto to the masses. Several companies have attempted the leap, but so far no one has succeeded.
